CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It's a security feature implemented in web browsers to control how web pages or web applications can request resources from another domain. When a web application hosted on one domain (origin) tries to access resources from a different domain (different origin), the browser's security policies may restrict such actions by default.
Working:
•	Same-Origin Policy: Browsers, by default, follow the Same-Origin Policy, which restricts JavaScript code in a web page from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.
•	CORS Headers: When a browser detects a cross-origin request (e.g., an XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API request), it sends an HTTP request with an "Origin" header indicating the requesting domain. The server, in response, can include specific CORS headers indicating whether it allows requests from that origin.
Handling CORS-related Issues:
•	Server-side Configuration: To enable CORS, the server needs to respond with appropriate CORS headers allowing access from specific origins. These headers include Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Headers, etc.
•	Preflight Requests: For certain types of requests (e.g., PUT, DELETE, or requests with custom headers), the browser may send a preflight OPTIONS request to check if the server allows the actual request. The server must respond with appropriate CORS headers to allow the actual request.
•	Client-side Solutions: If you're developing a front-end application, using certain libraries or frameworks (like Axios for HTTP requests in JavaScript), they might offer built-in solutions or configurations to handle CORS issues.
•	Proxy Server: Another approach is to set up a proxy server that acts as an intermediary between your front-end and the server, which can forward requests and manage CORS headers appropriately.
